# π₀.₅ (pi05)

This repository contains the Hugging Face port of **π₀.₅**, adapted from [OpenPI](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi) by the Physical Intelligence.
It is designed as a **Vision-Language-Action model with open-world generalization**.

## Training Defaults

This repository's variant uses
`[VLM observation/language tokens] [VLM prompt tokens] [expert prompt tokens] [action tokens]`.
There are 16 trainable embeddings on each side by default (`num_vlm_prompt_tokens=16`,
`num_prompt_tokens=16`, `prompt_init_std=0.02`), using their respective backbone widths.
With the default VLM/expert variants, the two banks have **32,768 + 16,384 = 49,152 trainable
parameters**. VLM prompts see observation/language tokens and all VLM prompts; expert prompts see
the full VLM prefix and all expert prompts; actions see all four blocks. Observation/language
tokens do not attend to the prompts.

The entire VLM, action expert, action projections, and timestep MLP stay frozen in every phase.
`freeze_vision_encoder=true` and `train_expert_only=true` remain enforced legacy flags. The training
curriculum is unchanged: action-only inpainting updates expert prompts; the observation-conditioned
bridge and formal flow training update both prompt banks. At inference, VLM prompts are cached with
the VLM prefix and expert prompts are processed with actions at each denoising step; the action
chunk length is unchanged. With `cabo_enabled=false`, either prompt count may be `0` for an ablation.
Inpainting requires expert prompts, and training requires a nonempty bank. Both counts may be `0`
for inference with CABO disabled.

Fresh configurations use a unified AdamW learning rate of `2.5e-5` for both prompt banks,
followed by cosine decay to a `1e-5` floor. Global gradient clipping is disabled
(`optimizer_grad_clip_norm=0.0`). VLM-relative gradient clipping (`clip_action_head_by_vlm`) must
remain `false` for flow training.

CABO is enabled by default (`cabo_enabled=true`, `cabo_prompt_update_ratio=2.0`) and requires both
prompt banks. It uses named AdamW groups `vlm_prompt` and `action_prompt`. In the bridge and formal
flow phases, it limits the expert prompt's relative learning update to at most half of the VLM
prompt's: `r_action <= r_vlm / 2`, where `r = ||AdamW learning delta||₂ / ||prompt parameters||₂`
excludes decoupled weight decay. Only expert prompt updates above the cap are attenuated; VLM
updates are unchanged. Action-only inpainting bypasses CABO and updates expert prompts normally,
because its forward path omits the VLM. The three phases and learning-rate scheduler are unchanged.
Use a larger `cabo_prompt_update_ratio` for a lower expert prompt cap, or `cabo_enabled=false` to
disable CABO. The ratio accepts values of at least `1.0`. CABO requires
`use_policy_training_preset=true` so its named groups are constructed correctly.

The old expert/projection update ratios and CABO EMA, warmup, and floor settings remain loadable
for compatibility but do not affect prompt CABO, which uses the current VLM prompt update.

Loading a base or older full-model checkpoint initializes missing prompt banks while preserving
existing prompt weights. Loading a checkpoint saved by this variant preserves both learned banks.
To migrate an older training run, initialize a new run from its model weights: the old optimizer
layout differs after adding VLM prompts and freezing the action path. The former single-group
prompt optimizer also differs from CABO's two named prompt groups. See the
[training guide](./pi05.mdx) for the curriculum and checkpoint details.
Saved CABO settings are preserved. When loading a checkpoint that stored CABO disabled or ratio
`1.0`, pass `--policy.cabo_enabled=true --policy.cabo_prompt_update_ratio=2.0` explicitly.

PEFT defaults to saving only the two prompt banks through `modules_to_save`, with no backbone LoRA
adapters. Any custom backbone adapters remain frozen. Legacy adapters must save every enabled bank:
set `num_vlm_prompt_tokens=0` for an expert-prompt-only adapter, or both counts to `0` for inference
with an adapter containing neither bank; set `cabo_enabled=false` in either case. Initialize from a
full-model checkpoint to add missing banks.

## Relative Actions

π₀.₅ supports training with **relative actions**, where the model learns relative offsets
from the current robot state instead of absolute joint positions. This mirrors the
relative-action transform in OpenPI (`DeltaActions`) and can improve performance.

### How it works

1. **During preprocessing**, absolute actions are converted to relative offsets:
   `relative = action - state` (for selected joints).
2. The relative actions are normalized using statistics computed from the relative distribution.
3. **During postprocessing**, predicted relative actions are converted back to absolute:
   `absolute = relative + state`.

Joints listed in `relative_exclude_joints` (e.g., gripper) are kept absolute.

### Configuration

| Parameter                 | Type        | Default       | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `use_relative_actions`    | `bool`      | `False`       | Enable relative-action training                                  |
| `relative_exclude_joints` | `list[str]` | `["gripper"]` | Joint names to keep absolute (matched by substring)              |
| `action_feature_names`    | `list[str]` | `None`        | Auto-populated from dataset metadata at runtime by `make_policy` |

### Training example

```bash
uv run lerobot-train \
  --policy.type=pi05 \
  --dataset.repo_id=your_org/your_dataset \
  --policy.num_vlm_prompt_tokens=16 \
  --policy.num_prompt_tokens=16 \
  --policy.cabo_enabled=true \
  --policy.cabo_prompt_update_ratio=2.0 \
  --policy.train_expert_only=true \
  --policy.use_relative_actions=true \
  --policy.relative_exclude_joints='["gripper"]'
```

When `use_relative_actions=true`, the training script automatically:

- Computes relative action statistics from the dataset (sampled chunk-level relative actions)
- Replaces the standard action stats with relative stats for normalization
- Broadcasts these stats across all ranks in distributed training
